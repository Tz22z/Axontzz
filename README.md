# MemPlumber: Custom Memory Allocator in C++

A high-performance memory allocation framework built from scratch to explore operating system memory management and C++ systems programming.

## Goals

- Implement custom memory allocator without using malloc/free
- Direct OS memory management through system calls
- Performance comparison with standard allocators
- Thread-safe concurrent allocation

## Planned Features

- [ ] Direct mmap-based memory source
- [ ] Free-list allocator implementation  
- [ ] Slab allocator for same-size objects
- [ ] Thread safety and concurrency
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Comprehensive analysis and visualization

## Build

```bash
make all
make test
```
